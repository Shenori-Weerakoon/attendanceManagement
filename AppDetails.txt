Use case - Manage employee attendance

Steps to run the application :-
	1) Enter new attendance details - recordAttendance.jsp
		(eg: 	attendance id - 1
			employee id - EID101
			date - 10/11/2023
			login time - 7.30 AM
			logout time - 5.30 PM)

	2) Click "Submit attendance" button
		

	3) To view details, enter attendance id and submit.

	4) To edit information, click "edit info"

	5) To delete information, click "delete info"

Database name - company

Table name - attendance

PS: I was suggested to implement a validation part during the viva session and I implemented a validation to check attendance ID when the user wants to retrieve data from the database and view working details.
